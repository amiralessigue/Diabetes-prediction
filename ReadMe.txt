he dataset that will be used is from Kaggle: Pima Indians Diabetes Database

(https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
It has 9 variables: ‘Pregnancies’, ‘Glucose’,’BloodPressure’,’SkinThickness’,’Insulin’, ‘BMI’, ‘DiabetesPedigreeFunction’,’Age’, ‘Outcome’.

Here is the variable description from Kaggle:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

Age: Age (years)

Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

All these variables are continuous, the goal of the tutorial is to predict if someone has diabetes (Outcome=1) according to the other variables. It worth noticing that all the observations are from women older than 21 years old.
